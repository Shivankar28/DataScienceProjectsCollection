# Spacecraft Landing Prediction Project
Overview
The Spacecraft Landing Prediction project focuses on predicting the successful recovery of the propulsion first phase of a rocket during spacecraft landings. Inspired by SpaceX's reusable rocket technology, the goal is to enhance the prediction accuracy of successful landings. The project utilizes a diverse tech stack, including data wrangling, web scraping, Folium for map visualization, data visualization techniques, and machine learning algorithms.

Project Components
1. Data Wrangling
The project involves gathering, cleaning, and transforming relevant data related to spacecraft landings. Techniques from pandas and other data wrangling tools are employed.
2. Web Scraping
Web scraping is used to extract additional landing-related data from various sources. This data supplements the existing dataset, enhancing the predictive model's robustness.
3. Folium Data Visualization
Folium is employed to create interactive maps showcasing spacecraft landing locations. This helps in visualizing patterns and trends in landing success.
4. Data Visualization
The project includes visualizing key landing metrics using various plotting libraries. This aids in understanding the factors influencing successful landings.
5. Machine Learning Algorithms
Machine learning models are implemented to predict the likelihood of successful rocket landings. Historical data is used to train and test the models, improving their accuracy over time.
